This study aims to collect ratings for the simplification of patent sentences that originally could have been considered difficult to read and understand. You will be reading sentences extracted from patents. The nature of the sentences and their language is such that they are unlikely to cause offense, disturbance, or distress to readers from a general audience. However, if you feel uncomfortable with the content of any sentences, please let us know in the Suggestions box provided.



The collected data will be used for research purposes only. However, the data collected will be made available to other researchers, and the results of this investigation may be published in scientific journals or conferences and may be used in further studies.



To participate in this experiment, you must:

	Be an English native speaker
	Be at least 18 years old and competent to provide consent
	Have read and understood the information provided about the research project
